    <p>
        To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial 
        institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an aaccount. Consequently, when you 
        apply for an account, we will ask for your name, address, Social Security number and date of birth and other identifying 
        information we may deem necessary in order to comply with regulatory requirements. In addition, by applying for an account, you 
        are providing the Bank your consent to obtain information about you from other sources, to verify your credit information and 
        identity, and to periodically update your demographic information, such as residential address, occupation and place of work. 
        The Bank may obtain such information from our own records, from other financial institutions or from any other commercially 
        available databases, such as credit reporting agencies.

        Payments through TelePago Popular® and AutoPay Service through Internet Banking and Mi Banco Comercial
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use the Service to make payments to available creditors designated by you. When you give the Bank instructions to make payments, the Bank can debit the 
        Designated Account and will 1) credit the creditor's account with the Bank; 2) electronically send the creditor the payment; or 3) send an official check by 
        regular mail to the creditor, as the Bank determines.
    </p>
    <p class="header">
        Payment Categories that can be made through the TelePago Popular® Service:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1.   Automatic Payments</b> – These payments allow you to preauthorize the Bank to make periodic Payments without having to give additional instructions each 
        time you want the Bank to make a Payment. Automatic Payments can be:
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <b>Fixed.</b> You can authorize the Bank to debit from the Designated Account a fixed amount for a set period of time. Fixed automatic payments require that 
            you set the day on which you want the Bank to debit the Designated Account and the period of time for which the Bank will make the debits. For example, you 
            can instruct the Bank to pay the set amount of $20.00 to your credit card account on the 15th of each month for a period of 18 months.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Variable.</b> You can authorize the Bank to debit from the Designated Account a dollar amount that can vary during each billing period. For example, you 
            can instruct the Bank to pay the minimum monthly payment reflected on your credit card statement (which will vary depending on the average daily balance of 
            the credit card account). The Bank will provide you with notice of the amount and date of payment at least ten (10) days prior to the effective Payment date, 
            unless you have indicated pre-established amounts the Bank is authorized to pay, in which case, the Bank will provide you ten (10) day advance notice only if 
            the payment amount falls outside the pre-established amounts.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <b>2.  One-Time Payments</b> – For easy payments, you can give the Bank instructions regarding the exact amount and date the payment is to be made, each time you 
        access the Service.
    </p>
    <p class="header">
        Automatic Payment Categories to credit cards of the Bank that can be made through the AutoPay Service:
    </p>
    <p class="header">
        A.  New total balance payment:
    </p>
    <p>
        By selecting the automatic payment option "New Total Balance", you authorize the Bank to debit the Designated Account for the new total balance shown on the credit 
        card account statement. This payment could vary each month so you can establish a maximum amount to be debited from your Designated Account. To use this option, 
        you must have a deposit account with the Bank.
    </p>
    <p class="header">
        B.  Minimum amount payment:
    </p>
    <p>
        By selecting the automatic payment option "Minimum Payment", you authorize the Bank to debit the Designated Account for the minimum amount shown on the credit card 
        account statement. This amount could vary each month. To use this option, you must have a deposit account with the Bank.
    </p>
    <p class="header">
        C.  Fixed amount payment:
    </p>
    <p>
        When selecting the automatic payment option "Fixed Amount", the Bank will debit the Designated Account for the fixed amount assigned. If the fixed amount is lower than 
        the minimum payment in your account statement, you must make additional payments to complete the minimum payment. Otherwise, penalties related to your Credit Account 
        Agreement can apply.
    </p>
    <p>
        You acknowledge that some of the fixed automatic payments can vary while the Service is in effect. <b>IF A CHANGE OCCURS IN THE AMOUNT OF THE FIXED PAYMENT, FREQUENCY 
        OR ACCOUNT NUMBER WITH THE PAYEE, IT IS EXPRESSLY AGREED THAT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THESE CHANGES.</b> This notice of change must be made 10 days before 
        the effective day of the payment, for the adjustment to be made before the date designated for the processing of the payment. The adjustment in the payment will not 
        be effective until the Bank receives and processes the notice of the change. The Bank will not be liable for discrepancies in any fixed payments made before receiving 
        and processing the described notice of change.

        time to process the delivery. The Bank will not be liable or guarantee that the payment can be processed, transferred or sent before the due date. Also, the Bank will not 
        be liable for: (a) errors or delays by the creditor in crediting payments made through the Service or (b) delays in the delivery and processing of payments caused by the

        in controversy and (b) notify you with the results of said investigation within a period of ten (10) business days from the date in which you submitted your request for an 
        investigation of the payment in controversy.

    <p>
        The Bank will not be liable for payments not accepted by the creditor. If the Bank is notified by the creditor that the payment was not accepted, the Bank’s responsibility 
        will be limited to: (a) reverse the debit for the corresponding rejected payment on the same day in which the returned payment is received and (b) notify you of the rejection 
        of the Payment no later than the following business day in which the returned payment is received.

        WHATSOEVER SUFFERED BY YOU AS A CONSEQUENCE OF PAYMENTS MADE AFTER THEIR DUE DATE, IF SAID DELAY IN THE PAYMENT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LATE NOTICE FROM THE CLIENT.
        <b>IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE OBLIGATION OF NOTIFYING THE BANK THE AMOUNT AND DATE WHEN ANY VARIABLE PAYMENT WILL BE MADE, THE BANK’S OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE FOR 
        SAID PAYMENT WILL END. IF THE DESIGNATED ACCOUNT IS A PERSONAL ACCOUNT, YOU WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE BANK’S LIABILITY AND ERROR RESOLUTION PROCEDURES,

        2 Step Verification
    </p>
    <p>
        2 Step Verification is a service that adds an additional layer of security to your Mi Banco profile. If you enable the 2-Step Verification Service, instead of answering security questions, you could 
        receive a unique code as an authentication method for Mi Banco Online. You may also choose if you want to receive this code every time you try to log in to Mi Banco Online or if you prefer to allow 
        the Bank to determine if the security questions should be displayed or the unique code requested.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may choose to receive the unique code through a voice call or via text message (SMS) to the mobile phone number registered on Mi Banco Online. You can register up to two mobile phone numbers to 
        receive the unique code, if you have more than one number.
    </p>
    <p>
        To subscribe to the Service, you must do so on My Information section in Mi Banco Online (web version). The 2-Step Verification Service does not require any specific service or product with the Bank; 
        you just need to be enrolled in Mi Banco Online. Even though the 2-Step Verification Service is free, your mobile service provider could apply messaging or call charges.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you subscribe to the 2-Step Verification Service, you will receive a recovery code, which you should keep in a secure place. This code will let you regain access to your Mi Banco Online account 
        in the event you lose access to your mobile device, or any phone registered in the Service or in the event you have no mobile service coverage. Nevertheless, it is important to know that once you 
        use your recovery code, the 2-Step Verification Service will automatically deactivate; therefore, to keep using Mi Banco, you must subscribe once again to the 2-Step Verification following the original 
        procedure – in My Information section on Mi Banco Online (web version). If you lose access to your registered mobile phones and your recovery code, you can contact our Customer Service Department 
        (Telebanco) or visit any of our branches to regain access to your accounts through Mi Banco.

        The ON / OFF feature allows Mi Banco Móvil users the option to use the OFF button to temporarily block the processing of certain debit card transactions. It also allows them to use the ON button to unlock 
        a previously blocked card. The feature is available to account owners, signatories, and custodians only through the Mi Banco Móvil app.    
    </p>

        In the case of a card renewal or replacement of an existing card that you have previously blocked using the "OFF" functionality, you must proceed to the initial activation of the new card as you would 
        normally do, but the existing card will continue to be "OFF" until you mark it "ON" in Mi Banco Móvil.
        <br>
        Any of the owners, signatories, and custodians of an active account in Mi Banco may use the ON/ OFF service to block and/or unlock any of the cards related to that account, even if the card that is 
        blocked is the card used by someone else on the account.  Banco Popular sends a notification to the owner, signatory or custodian who blocked or unblocked the card.

            Remember that charges may apply depending on your mobile operator’s plan for each text message received, or for wireless internet access.</li>
        <li>Participating mobile operators in Puerto Rico: AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Open Mobile, Claro de Puerto Rico. You must have a cellular service to receive the messages. We are not responsible for problems 
            in the communication networks between cell phone companies and messaging.</li>

        <u>Terms of use</u>

        Retiro Móvil is subject to the same usage limitations and restrictions as the use of an debit card at an ATM, including how often you can make transactions or dollar amount you can withdraw. You 
        can find these limitations and restrictions on the debit card disclosures included in your Deposit Account Agreement. Therefore, the withdrawals you make using Retiro Móvil are added to the total 
        of withdrawals you make during the day with the debit card. For example, if the daily withdrawal limit on your Banco Popular debit card is $500, and you withdraw $100 by sliding or by entering your 
        debit card at an ATM, then you can only withdraw up to $400 using Retiro Móvil from the same account on the same day.

        your check. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your account (plus your maximum line of credit).</b>  If you tell us within two (2) business 
        days after you learn of the loss or theft of your card, you may lose no more than $50 if someone used your card without your permission.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do NOT notify us within two (2) business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your card, code or PIN, and we can prove that we could have stopped someone from using your card, code 
        or PIN without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made by card, PIN or other means, tell us at once. If You do not notify us within sixty (60) days after the statement 
        was mailed to you,  you may not get back any money you lost after the sixty (60) days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.
    </p> 
    <p>
        If a good reason (such as long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods.
